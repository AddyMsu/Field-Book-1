InfoBars
~~~~~~~~
The InfoBars display information about the current plot and can be customized to show any data that was imported with the field file.

Trait navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The small, green arrows will move between the different traits that are currently active. Pressing the current trait will show a list of all currently active traits.

Entry navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The large, black arrows will move between different entries. Pressing and holding these arrows will continuously scroll. The longer the arrows are pressed, the faster the scrolling becomes.

Data input
~~~~~~~~~~
The bottom area of the screen is used to input data. Each trait format has a different layout. The elements and layout of this area change based on the trait that is currently active.

Bottom toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the bottom of the screen are two buttons to save data as NA or delete data.

Navigation
----------
To collect data, use the black arrows to navigate to the plot for which data should be collected and navigate to the specific trait you want to collect. The input area at the bottom of the screen will adjust to match the layout of the trait that is being collected. Data is saved to an internal database as it is collected. Each trait has a specific layout that helps to rapidly collect organized data.
