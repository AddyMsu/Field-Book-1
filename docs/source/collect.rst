   Data collection screen


Overview
--------

To collect data, use the black arrows to navigate to the plot for which data should be collected and navigate to the specific trait you want to collect. The input area at the bottom of the screen will adjust to match the layout of the trait that is being collected. Data is saved to an internal database as it is collected. Each trait has a specific layout that helps to rapidly collect organized data.

Layout Details
--------------

Top toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, there are four buttons at the top of the screen (in addtion to the back navigation arrow).

* The first (|search|) opens a search dialog for finding a specific entry.
* The second (|resources|) opens reference images from the resources folder.
* The third (|summary|) opens a display of all info for the current entry.
* The fourth (|lock|) freezes/unfreeezes the data input section to prevent accidental changes.

More buttons are added by enabling optional tools in :doc:`settings-general` (|settings|).
