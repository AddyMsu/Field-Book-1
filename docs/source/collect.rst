Collect
=======
Overview
--------

Field Book aims to optimize the amount of visible information to increase the rate at which data can be collected. For collection, only a single entry and trait are visible when collecting data. This reduces the risk of error and allows efficient layouts to be used for data input. The small green arrows are used to navigate between triats. The large black arrows are used to navigate between entries. Data is entered in the bottom area of the screen which adjusts to match the current trait format. Data is saved to an internal database as it is collected.

Collect Screen Details
----------------------

Top toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, there are four buttons at the top of the screen (in addtion to the back navigation arrow).

* The first (|search|) opens a search dialog for finding a specific entry.
* The second (|resources|) opens reference images from the resources folder.
* The third (|summary|) opens a display of all info for the current entry.
* The fourth (|lock|) freezes/unfreeezes the data input section to prevent accidental changes.

More buttons are added by enabling optional tools in :doc:`settings-general` (|settings|).

The large, black arrows navigate between different entries. Pressing and holding these arrows will continuously scroll. The longer the arrows are pressed, the faster the scrolling becomes.

Data input

The bottom half of the screen is used to input data. The elements and layout of this area change based on the trait that is currently active. Information for each specific format can be found in the Trait Formats pages.

Bottom toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bottom toolbar contains three buttons for data input:

* |scan| enters data by scanning a barcode.
* |na| enters NA.
* |delete| clears the entered data.
