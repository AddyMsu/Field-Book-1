After installing and opening the app, you will be asked to define a 'Storage location' on the device. In Field Book, this step is not optional. The selected 'Storage location' can be changed in the :doc:`/settings-general`.

Subdirectories
--------------

After installing and opening the app, you will be asked to define a 'Storage location' on the device. Selecting this directory is necessary to simplifying how data is managed within Field Book.

If you skip defining the 'Storage location' directory, you will be required to select an export location and name for each file that is exported from Coordinate. The selected 'Storage location' can be changed in the :doc:`/settings`.

Subdirectories within the 'Storage location' directory include: **field_import**, **field_export**, **plot_data**, **resources**, **database**, **trait**, and **archive**.

* **field_import**: contains files that can be imported into Field Book

* **field_export**: contains exported data files

* **plot_data**: data associated with plots (audio and photos) are organized into this folder based on the field name

* **resources**: allows the user to access photos/documents while collecting data (e.g. rating scales, field maps, etc.)

* **database**: contains automatic and manual database export files

* **trait**: contains trait files and the rust rating customizable scale

* **archive**: contains backups when the user chooses to overwrite previously exported fields
