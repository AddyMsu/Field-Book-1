Storage
=======

After installing and opening the app, you will be asked to define a 'Storage location' on the device. Selecting this directory is necessary to simplifying how data is managed within Field Book.

If you skip defining the 'Storage location' directory, you will be required to select an export location and name for each file that is exported from Coordinate. The selected 'Storage location' can be changed in the :doc:`/settings`.

There are three subdirectories within the 'Storage location' directory: **Exports**, **Templates**, and **Database**.

* **Exports**: contains the grid files that are exported after collecting data

* **Templates**: contains the template files that can be exported and shared between devices

* **Database**: contains the database files that can be exported and used to help with debugging or moving to a new device
