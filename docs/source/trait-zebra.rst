Zebra Label Print Trait |print|
===============================
Overview
--------

The Zebra Label print trait format is used to print labels from an external printer. The trait is designed to work with Zebra's `ZQ500 Series<https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/printers/mobile/zq500.html>`_ of ruggedized, mobile printers. It is created with a trait name and optional details.

To use this trait, the Zebra printer must first be paired with the Android phone or tablet via bluetooth. Label size, barcode, specific data, and number of copies are selected and are saved as defaults. Pressing the print button will print the desired number of labels, each containing a barcode and ID for the specific entry, along with the selected additional data.
