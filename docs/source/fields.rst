Importing a field
======

To import a new field into Field Book press the Add icon (|add|) in the upper right-hand corner of the toolbar in the Fields section. Fields can be imported via cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), a BrAPI connection, or from a local file on the device.

Local storage
---------

If local is chosen, a list of possible CSV, XLS, and XLSX files in the /import_fields/ folder will be displayed. Add files to this folder by downloading them or transferring them from a computer.

To transfer files from a computer, connect your Android device via a usb cable and change it's USB mode to allow file transfer. Each device manufacturer has slight variations for the appearance of this dialog.

   Example settings for USB file transfer.

Import files must be saved in CSV, XLS, or XLSX format. Filenames and column headers should exclude the following special characters: **/ ?  < > \ * | ‚Äù**.

Files must have at least three columns: a unique identifier, a primary identifier, and a secondary identifier. Each entry in the import file should be assigned a unique identifier. This unique ID is used internally to associate data with a specific entry and must be unique across all of your files.

The primary and secondary identifier are often used for field orientation (e.g., row/plot, row/column, range/plot, etc.), and can be whatever makes the most sense for your specific experiment.

Extra columns (e.g. name, pedigree) can optionally be included in the file, they become additional display options in the InfoBars on the main screen.
