Barcodes
========
Many Android devices are natively compatible with USB barcode scanners. These scanners act as a hardware keyboard and can be used to directly capture data from barcodes into text traits.
Â 
Barcoded height sticks have been used to rapidly capture plot height values (Figure 10). Attaching the Android device to the stick makes it possible to accurately capture height without having to handle the device.

Barcode resources are available on GitHub.
