Barcodes
========
Fieldbook has many built-in barcode scanning features that use the device camera to scan. However, in addition to these tools many Android devices are natively compatible with external barcode scanners.

These scanners connect via usb or bluetooth, and act as a hardware keyboard. They can be used to directly capture data from barcodes into any input field that uses the device keyboard, which includes many traits.

For example, barcoded height sticks can be used to rapidly capture plot height values. Attaching the Android device to the stick makes it possible to accurately capture height without having to handle the device.
