   About screen

The About screen provides contextual information about the app. This inlcudes the installed version, and access to the changelog to view a list of the most recently added features and fixes. Also an update tool to check the availability of newer versions.

Further down the list are links to rate the app, to join the team of Field-Book app translators, and to contact the project lead and development team.
