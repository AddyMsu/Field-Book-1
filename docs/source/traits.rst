Data is collected in Field Book by creating traits. Different trait formats utilize different layouts and features to streamline how the data is collected. The traits screen allows for the management of the current traits within Field Book and lets the user create new traits or modify existing traits.

Creating
--------
Traits can be created by pressing the brown Add Trait button at the bottom or top of the screen. Each trait has a custom creation menu that indicates which fields are required. Traits cannot share the same name.

Sorting
-------
Each trait has options to make data collection easier (Figure 5). The menu icon on each line allows each trait to deleted, copied, or edited. The checkbox allows traits to be active or hidden on the main layout screen. Traits can be reordered by dragging and dropping the icon on the right of each trait line. Traits can also be sorted by their name, format, or active status using the sort icon on the toolbar. To make all traits active or hidden, use the checkbox icon on the toolbar.

Importing/Exporting
-------------------
Lists of traits can be created and transferred between different devices using the Import/Export option on the toolbar. Trait lists are stored in the /trait/ folder.
