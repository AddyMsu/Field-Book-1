Traits
======
Overview
--------

Data is collected in Field Book via traits. The traits screen lets you create new traits and manage existing traits. Each trait is created by specifying a trait type, a trait name, and additional fields such as min, max, or default values. These settings optimize how the trait is formatted in the collect screen.

Creating a Trait
----------------
Traits can be created by pressing the large Add icon (|add|) at the bottom right of the screen, or the same icon in the toolbar. Each trait has a custom creation menu that indicates which fields are required. Traits cannot share the same name.

Managing Traits
---------------

Once created, traits can be manipulated on the trait screen using the following features:

  * The stacked line icon on the far left of each trait line can pressed and held to drag and drop the trait and create a new trait ordering.
  * The menu icon on each trait line opens a menu where the trait can be copied, edited, or deleted.
  * The checkbox can be checked to make a trait active, or unchecked to prevent it from showing up on the :doc:`collect` (|collect|) screen.

Traits can also be sorted by their name, format, or active status using the sort icon on the toolbar. To make all traits active or hidden, use the Double Check icon (|check-all|) on the toolbar.

Importing/Exporting Traits
--------------------------
Lists of traits can be created and transferred between different devices using the Import/Export option on the toolbar. Trait lists are stored in the **trait** folder and use the CSV format, but with a custom *.trt* extension.
