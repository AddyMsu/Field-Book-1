Field Book
==========

Introduction
------------
Field Book is an open-source Android app that can be used to collect data on field research plots. When used in place of paper field books, it eliminates the need for data transcription and reduces the risk of errors. It runs on a wide range of inexpensive hardware, allowing consumer-grade  technology to be used in environments where cost and inflexibility have been limiting factors. The source code for Field Book is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book>`_.

Getting Started
---------------
Field Book can be downloaded from the `Google Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tracker.fieldbook>`_ or can be installed manually using the latest .apk file from the `GitHub releases <https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book/releases>`_ page. After installing the app, all permissions should be accepted so that the app is able to read/write data and access device features. Once permissions are accepted, optional example data can be loaded. The example data consists of three sample fields and a list of sample traits. All of the images in the manual utilize this data.
