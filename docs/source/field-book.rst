Field Book
==========


Introduction
------------
Field Book is an open-source Android app that can be used to collect data on field research plots. By working with on an open platform with inexpensive hardware, we have created an app that will replace paper field books and their associated transcription errors and allow current technology to be used in environments where cost and inflexibility have been limiting factors. The source code for Field Book is available on GitHub.


Getting Started
---------------
Field Book can be downloaded from Google Play or can be installed manually from GitHub. After installing the app, all permissions should be accepted so that the app is able to read/write data and access device features. Once permissions are accepted, sample data can be loaded which creates several sample fields and a list of sample traits to demonstrate all the different trait formats.
