|flask| Repeated Measures 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turns on repeated measures. When turned on, a green plus symbol appears next to trait values entered on the collect screen. When pressed it creates a new entry field for collecting an additional observation on the same plot for the same trait. Repeated measures are then differentiated by timestamp.
